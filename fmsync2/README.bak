This script now implements API for DDD, FOS and ADS,
to synchronize all required configuration

DDD supports
- sync all configuration items
- keep persistent information about IDs
- configurable functions (active/active or active/passive for script mitigation)
- live check to switch itself to master

FOS
- roles - for FOS 10.3.x
- users - for FOS 10.3.x
- profiles
- business hours
- blacklists
- chapters
- reports
- email reports
- alerts

ADS
- data feeds
- filters
- perpectives
- methods and their instances (with exception of custom blacklist as they cannot be synced now)
- email event reporting
